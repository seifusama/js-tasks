Create a simple sticky notes application which consists of two pages:

1- A page which contains a form to add a new note
2- A page which displays all the notes, and a link to the other page

Use MongoDB to store the notes.
Use HTML templates (EJS, Pug, or any of your choice) to render the views for notes.

- Make sure your config files are well-configured.
- Make sure the package.json file has scripts: build and start and make sure they're working correctly.
- Add the build directory to the .gitignore file. There's no need to add compiled files to the repository.
- DON'T USE "any" TYPE
