# JavaScript and TypeScript Tasks

This repository contains various JavaScript and TypeScript tasks that demonstrate key concepts, patterns, and solutions in both languages. These tasks cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Algorithms and data structures
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional programming
- Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await)
- Regular Expressions
- Web development with Express.js
- TypeScript-specific features like Interfaces, Generics, and type declarations

## Tasks Overview

Each task has been implemented in either JavaScript or TypeScript and may include:

- Problem description
- Code solution
- Explanation of the code and logic behind the solution

### JavaScript Tasks
The JavaScript tasks focus on traditional JavaScript, ES6+ features, and practical solutions for various algorithmic and programming challenges.

#### Examples of JavaScript Tasks:
- Array and object manipulation
- String operations using Regular Expressions
- Creating APIs with Node.js and Express
- DOM manipulation in the browser
- Web scraping and handling file I/O

### TypeScript Tasks
The TypeScript tasks demonstrate the use of static typing, interfaces, generics, and classes. These tasks show how TypeScript enhances JavaScript with its type-checking features.

#### Examples of TypeScript Tasks:
- Type-safe array manipulation with generics
- Implementing classes and interfaces in TypeScript
- Working with type assertions and strict type checks
- Error handling and validation using TypeScript


## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The main programming language for many tasks.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side tasks.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs and web applications.
- **npm**: Node.js package manager for handling dependencies.
